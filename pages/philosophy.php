        Give and Take...
    </h1><br>
        <p>
            Apart from the obvious fact, that wood is a beautiful material we 
            have some deeper concerns when it comes to making choices in our 
            every-day life.<br>
            Our philosophy is, that we have to learn to give back to nature, 
            what we take - no more and no less!<br><br>
            We work together with local plantations and make sure, that the amount
            of trees we use for our production is put back in the ground.<br><br>
            We use only solid, organic woods and oils instead of presswood and varnish.<br><br>
            5% of our profit goes to inviromental NGOs.<br><br>
