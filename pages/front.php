                <p>
                    Apart from the obvious fact, that wood is a beautiful material we 
                    have some deeper concerns when it comes to making choices in our 
                    every-day life.<br>
                    Our philosophy is, that we have to learn to give back to nature, 
                    what we take - no more and no less!<br>
                    We work together with local plantations and make sure, that the amount
                    of trees we use for our production is put back in the ground.
                    We work with fellow humans that are as dedicated as we are to perpetuating 
                    the sustainability of our precious resources.<br>
                    We use only solid, organic woods and oils instead of presswood and varnish.
